# data-engineering-labs
This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and code from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. It includes exercises and experiments in Docker, Python, SQL, Airflow, Data Lake, Data Warehouse, and more. I'm using this repo to track my progress and apply the concepts learned each week.
